                    <p class="text-start">Seedkaro aims to act as a bridge that connects high quality founders with a previously untapped but extremely knowledgeable investor base.</p>
                    <p class="text-start">With first hand experience, we have often noticed that founders who lack backing of a corporate sponsor or those who do not belong to an alumini network of an A-grade B- school often find it frustrating to gain access to equity funding. In similar vier, individual investors who have access to capital as well as experience to provide mentorship, are often not easily provided access to private equity as an asset class.</p>
                    <p class="text-start">At seedkaro, our vision is to bridge this gap and connect passionate, top quality and credible founders with traditional but experienced and "Unbanked" investors. We are fully aware of the time consuming nature of the fund raising process and aim to provide seedkaro as a unified integrated platform to manage the entire fund raising process in a safe, secure and seamless manner.</p>

        <p class="text-black">If we see a person who is successful, it is often assumed that they are happy. On an existential level we should consider what it all means. In reality, we actually have no idea whether or not that person is either happy or successful; for a couple of reasons: First of all, we can only measure someone else’s success or happiness by what we know about them. Secondly, and more importantly, we can only measure someone else’s success or happiness by how we define success and happiness. 
          There is really no way of knowing whether their measures are even similar to our own.</p>

          <p class="text-black">Financial success, on a holistic level, is about more than just accumulating money and being financially stable. Success, for most of us, fosters a sense of well-being and peace-of-mind. Setting goals on the foundation of what is important to you and your family will help to accomplish this.</p>
        
          <p class="text-black">We are practically programmed at birth to look over the neighbor’s fence to see what’s in their yard. When we are young it is a shiny scooter (or these days iPad or Drone or Hoverboard), as we age the shiny things become larger, more expensive and more of a driving force for our day to day money choices. Keeping up with the Joneses is an extremely destructive way to look at and deal with finances. For most of us it might provide some type of short-term satisfaction but, in most cases, that is followed by longer term regret and disappointment.</p>

          <p class="text-black">Many of our clients find this particularly challenging as some of the difficulties that they could possibly face are unknown to them. For example, making a large purchase and using retirement income to fund it can have major tax implications, or it may be in your best interest. There are many factors that go into determining the right choice for a particular situation. We help our clients understand their options and find the path of least resistance to the goal they are trying to accomplish.</p>
